# README: Experiment Guide — Hierarchical Priors RDK EEG Task

This file provides a experimental guide linking the analysis of *Buchholz & Hesselmann (in review) - Hierarchical Priors Shape Dynamic Evidence Accumulation and Aperiodic EEG Activity* with the here provided data and code. This can be used as an assisting tool for first running a semi-automated BIDS-EEG pipeline.

This EEG-BIDS dataset contains cue-locked EEG recordings and event annotations from a random-dot kinematogram (RDK) task designed to dissociate low-level and high-level priors during perceptual decision-making. The accompanying analysis tests whether hierarchical priors bias behavior through signal detection theory (SDT) and generalized drift-diffusion modeling (gDDM), and whether they modulate occipital oscillatory or aperiodic EEG activity.

The trial-level variables needed for analysis are stored in `epochs.metadata` and are illustrated by the accompanying `metadata.csv` file. Each row corresponds to one cue-locked epoch/trial retained in the MNE `Epochs` object. Participant-level questionnaire and trait variables are stored in `trait_variables.csv`, with one row per participant. Additionally, [trigger codes](#trigger-codes) stored as annotations enable (less flexible) trial-wise analyses.

## Data collection

Data were collected from neurotypical adults with normal or corrected-to-normal vision and no neurological or psychiatric diagnoses. Fifty-three participants were tested; twelve were excluded for failing the preregistered discrimination-performance criterion, leaving 43 participants in the final sample (27 female, 1 trans; mean age 24.47 +/- 5.46 years). Participants gave written informed consent, were tested in the EEG laboratory of Psychologische Hochschule Berlin, and received course credit or monetary compensation.

Stimuli were random-dot kinematograms (RDKs) with 1200 white dots (0.078 deg; 2.53 deg/s) presented inside a circular aperture (radius 9.09 deg). A subset of dots moved coherently leftward or rightward while the remaining dots moved randomly; dot lifetime was limited to 24 frames (~100 ms). Stimuli were presented with PsychoPy on a 24.5-inch LCD monitor (240 Hz refresh rate) at a fixed viewing distance of 65 cm. Auditory cues were delivered for 500 ms at 84.8 dB(A); each trial then included an approximately 1000 ms fixation-only interval, RDK presentation for up to approximately 3000 ms or until response, and a jittered 1000-1500 ms intertrial interval.

The experiment used a within-subject design with three conditions: baseline/no prior, low-level prior, and high-level prior. Baseline blocks used a neutral 750 Hz tone and comprised 8 blocks of 20 trials. Low-level priors were induced implicitly by 600/900 Hz tones that predicted leftward or rightward motion with 75% contingency; tone-motion mappings were counterbalanced, learned across 3 blocks of 20 trials, and tested across 8 blocks of 20 trials. High-level priors were induced by a standardized cover story about tinted glasses that allegedly enhanced leftward or rightward motion; beliefs were reinforced across 4 learning blocks of 20 trials and tested across 8 blocks of 20 trials. Condition order was fully counterbalanced, and 160 trials per condition entered the main analyses.

Before the experiment, individual motion sensitivity was estimated with two 40-trial QUEST staircases targeting 75% discrimination accuracy. The final threshold defined medium coherence; low and high coherence were 50% and 200% of this threshold, respectively. Learning blocks overrepresented medium- and high-coherence trials to support prior acquisition, whereas baseline and test blocks overrepresented low-coherence trials and contained no high-coherence trials to increase reliance on prior information.

Continuous EEG was recorded from 31 active Ag/AgCl electrodes arranged according to the international 10/20 system using an actiChamp Plus amplifier at 1000 Hz. The ground electrode was placed at FPz and data were online referenced to FCz. Electrode impedances were kept below 20 kOhm, and participants were instructed to minimize blinks, saccades, muscle activity, and body movement during recording. Post-experimental questionnaires assessed demographics, manipulation checks, belief strength, psychosis proneness, and psychological flexibility/inflexibility traits. These participant-level variables are documented in `[trait_variables.csv](#traits_cleancsv-questionnaire-and-trait-column-dictionary)`.

## Task summary

Each trial followed this sequence:

1. auditory cue/tone onset;
2. fixation-only interstimulus interval (ISI; approximately 1000 ms);
3. RDK onset with leftward or rightward net motion at individualized coherence;
4. left/right response, followed by a jittered intertrial interval (ITI; approximately 1000–1500 ms).

Motion coherence was individualized with two QUEST staircases targeting 75% discrimination accuracy. The resulting threshold defined the medium coherence level. Low coherence was 50% of this threshold; high coherence was 200% of this threshold.

The experiment contained three within-subject conditions:

- **Baseline / no prior** (`exp = base`): a neutral, nonpredictive 750 Hz tone preceded the RDK.
- **Low-level prior** (`exp = lowlevel`): two tones (600/900 Hz) predicted leftward or rightward motion with 75% contingency. Participants were not informed about the tone-motion association.
- **High-level prior** (`exp = highlevel`): the tone was neutral/nonpredictive, but participants wore transparent tinted glasses and were led to believe that the glasses enhanced perception of either leftward or rightward motion. This belief was reinforced during learning blocks before the analyzed test blocks.

The main analyses use baseline trials and prior-condition test trials. Learning blocks served to establish the tone-motion associations or glass beliefs and should not be included unless explicitly intended.

## Raw BIDS events

Each `*_events.tsv` file contains raw trigger-level events, and the `*_events.json` sidecar defines the BIDS event columns. Events are stored under `sub-0XX/ses-01/eeg/`.

**BIDS naming note:** the provided example sidecar is named `task-RDK_events.json`, whereas the provided example events file is named `task-HierPrior_events.tsv`. For strict BIDS compatibility, task labels should be identical across the EEG data file, events file, and JSON sidecar.

A raw trial can be reconstructed as:

`cue event (S_1/S_2/S_4) → RDK event (S_8/S_16) → response event (R_1/R_2, if present)`

For manuscript-level reproduction, use `epochs.metadata` rather than only the raw triggers, because the metadata contains condition labels, prior direction, motion coherence, counterbalancing, response direction, and behavioral exclusion flags.

### Psychosis-proneness score from `trait_variables.csv`

Psychosis proneness was assessed as a composite score derived from the PDI and CAPS endorsement sum scores, weighted by their relative number of items, following Eckert et al. (2023). This composite measure was then z-transformed before further processing. In practice, compute participant-level PDI and CAPS endorsement sums from the `*0` columns, weight them by scale length so that the 40-item PDI and 32-item CAPS contribute comparably, and then z-transform the resulting composite across participants.

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import zscore

pdi_endorsement_cols = [c for c in traits.columns if c.startswith("pdi_") and c.endswith("0")]
caps_endorsement_cols = [c for c in traits.columns if c.startswith("caps_") and c.endswith("0")]

# z-transformation & weighted sums 
for col in score_cols:
    mean = traits[col].mean()
    std = traits[col].std()
    traits[f'z_{col}'] = (traits[col] - mean) / std  # z-transform
    # weigthed pdi & caps (according to relative contribution to total item number)
    match col:
        case 'pdi_0_sum':
            traits[f'weight_{col}'] = (traits[col] * (40/72))
        case 'caps_0_sum':
            traits[f'weight_{col}'] = (traits[col] * (32/72))    

traits['psych_prone'] = traits['pdi_0_sum'] + traits['caps_0_sum']
traits['z_psych_prone'] = traits['z_pdi_0_sum'] + traits['z_caps_0_sum']
traits['weighted_psych_prone'] = traits['weight_pdi_0_sum'] + traits['weight_caps_0_sum']

```

Use `psychosis_proneness_z` for the manuscript-level correlations with participant-level prior effects. Use `highprior_strength` separately when testing whether subjective belief in the glasses relates to high-level prior effects.

## Reproducing the manuscript analyses from metadata

### 1. Recommended trial filters

For behavioral SDT and gDDM analyses, start from the metadata table and retain analyzed trials:

```python
meta_beh = metadata.query("exp in ['base', 'lowlevel', 'highlevel']").copy()
meta_beh = meta_beh.query("block_cond in ['base', 'test']").copy()
meta_beh = meta_beh[meta_beh['rt_flag'] == False]
meta_beh = meta_beh.dropna(subset=['response', 'rt', 'response_prior'])
```

When using preprocessed MNE `Epochs`, the rows in `epochs.metadata` remain aligned to the retained EEG epochs. If the exact manuscript behavioral analyses were run before EEG epoch rejection, a complete behavioral log may be needed to reproduce those behavioral trial counts exactly.

### 3. Signal detection theory coding

For SDT, the manuscript defined the signal differently for baseline and prior conditions. In prior conditions, signal-present trials are trials in which physical motion is congruent with the prior. In baseline trials, leftward motion is treated as the signal.

```python
import numpy as np

is_prior = meta_beh['exp'].isin(['lowlevel', 'highlevel'])

meta_beh['sdt_signal'] = np.where(
    is_prior,
    meta_beh['motion_direction'] == meta_beh['prior'],
    meta_beh['motion_direction'] == 'left'
)

meta_beh['sdt_signal_response'] = meta_beh['response_prior'] == 1
```

For each participant and condition, compute hit and false-alarm rates from `sdt_signal` and `sdt_signal_response`, then calculate criterion:

```python
c = -0.5 * (z_hit_rate + z_false_alarm_rate)
```

Negative criterion values in the prior conditions indicate a bias toward the prior-congruent direction.

### 4. Generalized drift-diffusion modeling coding

For each participant and condition, fit a gDDM using:


| gDDM input              | Metadata source      |
| ----------------------- | -------------------- |
| Response time           | `rt`                 |
| Binary response / bound | `response_prior`     |
| Condition               | `exp`                |
| Motion coherence        | `coh` or `coh_level` |
| Trial exclusion         | `rt_flag == False`   |


In the prior conditions, the decision bounds are prior-congruent (`response_prior = 1`) versus prior-incongruent (`response_prior = 0`). In the baseline condition, the same column codes left (`1`) versus right (`0`) responses. The manuscript estimated drift rate (`d`), boundary separation (`a`), and starting point (`z`), with noise fixed to 1, nondecision time fixed to 200 ms, maximum RT set to 3000 ms, and drift modeled as a function of motion coherence.

### 5. EEG time-frequency and spectral analyses

EEG analyses are cue-locked. Use the MNE epoch time axis rather than metadata onsets for time-resolved analyses.


| EEG analysis step                  | Metadata / data source                                               |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Epoch anchor                       | cue onset; rows in `epochs.metadata` correspond to cue-locked epochs |
| Epoch window                       | EEG time axis, -600 to 1500 ms relative to cue onset                 |
| Baseline interval                  | EEG time axis, -600 to -100 ms                                       |
| Condition factor                   | `exp`                                                                |
| Occipital channel cluster          | O1, Oz, O2 from EEG data                                             |
| TFR contrasts                      | `lowlevel` vs `base`; `highlevel` vs `base`                          |
| TFR frequency range                | 5–40 Hz                                                              |
| Spectral-parameterization window   | 0–1500 ms relative to cue onset                                      |
| Spectral-parameterization grouping | average/fit spectra separately by `participant` and `exp`            |


Spectral parameterization outputs are not stored in `epochs.metadata`. They should be computed from the EEG signal and then summarized by participant and condition as aperiodic offset, aperiodic exponent, and periodic alpha power.

### 6. Psychosis-proneness correlations

Psychosis-proneness measures are not stored in `epochs.metadata`; they are derived from `trait_variables.csv`. To reproduce the associative analyses:

1. compute participant-level behavioral prior metrics, preferably drift rates from the gDDM, separately for `lowlevel` and `highlevel`;
2. compute PDI and CAPS endorsement sum scores from `trait_variables.csv` using the `pdi_*0` and `caps_*0` columns;
3. derive the psychosis-proneness composite by weighting the PDI and CAPS sum scores by their relative number of items and z-transforming the composite across participants;
4. merge the resulting `psychosis_proneness_z` score with participant-level behavioral metrics by matching `trait_variables.csv:participant` to `epochs.metadata:participant`;
5. compute product-moment correlations between psychosis proneness and low-level/high-level drift-rate metrics.

## Variables not contained in `epochs.metadata`

The metadata table does not contain PDI scores, CAPS scores, the PDI/CAPS psychosis-proneness composite, VAS belief strength ratings, MPFI item responses, raw ICA labels, bad-channel interpolation logs, rejected-epoch annotations, SDT estimates, gDDM estimates, TFR outputs, or spectral-parameterization outputs. PDI, CAPS, MPFI, demographic, and VAS belief-strength variables are stored in `trait_variables.csv`; preprocessing variables must be obtained from preprocessing logs; SDT, gDDM, TFR, and spectral-parameterization variables must be obtained from analysis derivatives.

# [BIDS-EEG Processing Pipeline](https://github.com/jonathanbuc/BIDSEEG_Pipeline) - J.Buchholz

The current data was processed with the [BIDSEEG-Processing Pipeline](https://github.com/jonathanbuc/BIDSEEG_Pipeline). This pipeline enables easy-use, semi-automated processing of EEG-data from **BIDSraw** up to statistical analysis, including **preprocessing**, **artifact correction/rejection** and **conventional** and **parameterized frequency analysis**. The behavioral modules further enable **generlized and hierarchical drift diffusion modelling (g/hDDM)**. The implemented HSSM-package enables analysis of DDM-parameter with trial-by-trial covariates (i.e. expectations, ERPs, frequency measures.) All input can be provided via a single .json file, wherefore *no extensive coding expertise is required!*

The pipeline implements 4 modules:

1 *Preprocessing*:
    - Preprocessing BIDSified EEG data including downsampling, rereferencing, linenoise removal and filtering.

2 *Artifact Correction/Rejection*:
    - Data epoching, ICA (+ automatic OR manual artifactual IC deletion), bad channel interpolation (RANSAC), bad epoch deletion (autoreject).

3 *EEG Analysis*:
    - Computation of time-frequency representations, consecutive cluster-based permutation tests and spectral parameterization analysis (SpecParam, former FOOOF).

4 *Behavioral Analysis*:
    - Signal detection theory analysis and generalized drift diffusion modelling (+ predictive checks and parameter recovery study for parameter validation).

0.1 *BIDSification*:
    - If your data is not in BIDS-format yet, using `z_BIDSification_module.py` you can convert data from any output format (e.g. BrainVision) into BIDS (Brain Imaging Data Structure).

## 1. Conda Setup

### 1.1 Prerequisites

The pipeline is best executed within a conda environment. Follow the subsequent for successful setup.
Using the appropriate commands for your OS, e.g. Windows, MacOS, install `conda` from [Miniconda Install](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/install/) and follow the installation guide. 

Testing the installation:
    When the installation finishes, open your terminal application (find this by typing "terminal" into your computer's launchpad). Test your installation by running:

```bash
conda list
```

If conda has been installed correctly, a list of installed packages will appear.

### 1.2 Install Interpreter (Visual Studio Code)

We recommend using a interpreter like `Visual Studio Code` or `cursor`. You may install `VS Code` from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and follow the installation guide. Pipeline input can edited via .json-file and executed via the terminal within VS Code.

**For Windows-Users:** We recommend using  open VS Code from out your `Anaconda Prompt`. Open your Anaconda Prompt and run:

```bash
code
```

that way you have access to your conda environments in the terminal within VS Code

**For Mac-Users:** Just open `VS Code` from your applications.

**Clone the Repository**
After creating and activating the environment, clone the pipeline repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jonathanbuc/BIDSEEG_Pipeline.git
```

-> Now simply open a new terminal `Terminal/New Terminal` and proceed with steps 1.3 and 1.4

### 1.3 Setup conda in Anaconda Prompt (windows) or terminal (Mac)

In your terminal, check if you are in your repository **BIDSEEG_pipeline*
If not, navigate to the eeg pipeline via `cd path/to/BIDSEEG_pipeline` i.e., `cd C:\Users\YourName\Research\EEGresearch\BIDSEEG_pipeline`

### 1.4 Create a conda environment in your terminal (*anaconda prompt* = windows / *terminal* = Mac)

Install the provided conda environment via the .yml file. Be sure to execute the command within the *EEGpipeline* directory.

```bash
conda env create -f environment_setup.yml
```

--> Note, 'mne-env' is the default name of the conda environment you are creating within the *EEGpipeline* directory. You can define a different name by changing *name: mne-env* within the `environment_setup.yml` file

To **activate** your conda environment, run:

```bash
conda activate 'mne-env'
```

To **deactivate** your conda environment, run:

```bash
conda deactivate
```

### 1.5 Explore inputs.json

--> **IMPORTANT:** Consult the [ExperimentGuide_HierarchicalPriors.md](ExperimentGuide_HierarchicalPriors.md) file to gain a better understanding of the input structure.

- *inputs.json* is the dictionary that provides values for each of the subsequent steps (preprocessing, artifact correction, analysis)
- while exploring the pipeline, you may change the values in this file to see differences across different changes (i.e., change "samplingrate_down": 250 --> 500).
- please note, to use the updated inputs.json file, you must save the file to execute new commands.  Save = *ctl + s*

## 2. Usage - Quick Start

The `data/BIDShierPriors` contains 3 subjects from *Buchholz & Hesselmann (in review) - Hierarchical Priors Shape Dynamic Evidence Accumulation and Aperiodic EEG Activity* as testing data for an initial run (steps 2.1-2.4). 

**IMPORTANT**: Consider the [ExperimentGuide_HierarchicalPriors.md](ExperimentGuide_HierarchicalPriors.md), which provides a thorough linkage of the experiment and this pipeline. We recommend using this file as guideline when proceeding with steps `2.1-2.3` This file can also be used for a replication of the respective study.
